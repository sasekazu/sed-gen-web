This web application demonstrates the estimation of subcutaneous strain energy density (SED) from fingertip surface pressure using a machine learning model.
In Slider Mode, you can input test data collected for training purposes and display both the generated results and the corresponding ground truth images. By moving the slider, you can select different input pressure maps.
In Interactive Mode, you can input pressure distributions using your mouse. As you hover the mouse, a pressure distribution is generated around the cursor. By dragging the mouse, you can accumulate input data. Based on this input, the SED is estimated and visualized in real time.
